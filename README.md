The python modules here use various features of the Raspberry Pi embedded processors, such as the RP2040.  In particular, most of these of focused on input/output using the PIO units to handle protocols.

Right now, they are in first-upload status.  They are highly funcitonal, but only have partial docstrings describing them.  There is sample at the bottom showing how they can be used.
